SlickSettings
=============

A continuation of Fancy Settings

I wanted to be able to change/add things and found it to be a little hard or wrong.
Adding things like new option types required changing the main source and that felt wrong.
I assumed that due to it being Class based I could just extend and add new types, but couldn't.
I also didn't like it being dependent on MooTools.
Plus I wanted a few other things different like the manifest version, using Chromes i18n
, using Chromes storage api, different lay out, etc, so made this as an exercise for myself.
But as usual I lost interest.  I thought two people would be interested in it but when both
showed no interest I kinda lost interest and now I fear it will be lost in my hard drive with 
all my other half finished stuff so decided to put it on GitHub in the hope of not loosing it.
Although this can do everything Fancy Setting could do, I still feel that its not finished and 
wont be until it can upgrade settings gracefully and prolly have an inbuilt editor. 
One day Ill prolly come back and add those things, but if you feel like doing it then go ahead.
