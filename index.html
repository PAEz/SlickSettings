                This is a continuation of Fancy Settings by Frank Kohlhepp.<br />
                I wanted to be able to change/add things and found it to be a little hard or wrong.<br />
                Adding things like new option types required changing the main source and that felt wrong.<br />
				I assumed that due to it being Class based I could just extend and add new types, but couldn't.<br />
				I also didn't like it being dependent on MooTools.<br />
				Plus I wanted a few other things different like the manifest version, using Chromes i18n <br />
				, using Chromes storage api, different lay out, etc, so made this as an exercise for myself.<br />
				But as usual I lost interest.  I thought two people would be interested in it but when both<br />
				showed no interest I kinda lost interest and now I fear it will be lost in my hard drive with <br />
				all my other half finished stuff so decided to put it on GitHub in the hope of not loosing it.<br />
				Although this can do everything Fancy Setting could do, I still feel that its not finished and <br />
				wont be until it can upgrade settings gracefully and prolly have an inbuilt editor. <br />
				One day Ill prolly come back and add those things, but if you feel like doing it then go ahead.<br />
